# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

This assignment was to create a beginner portfolio using more advanced CSS and HTML.

## User Story

I intend to use this initial portfolio as a "jump off" point to build on throughout the bootcamp. I hope to make the portfolio look more polished as I progress with my skills.
